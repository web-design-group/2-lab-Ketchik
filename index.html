					<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
					<p>Four misfits—Garrett "The Garbage Man" Garrison (Momoa), Henry (Hansen), Natalie (Myers) and Dawn (Brooks)—find themselves struggling with ordinary problems when they are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into the Overworld: a bizarre, cubic wonderland that thrives on imagination. To get back home, they’ll have to master this world (and protect it from evil things like piglins and zombies, too) while embarking on a magical quest with an unexpected, expert crafter, Steve (Black). Together, their adventure will challenge all five to be bold and to reconnect with the qualities that make each of them uniquely creative... the very skills they need to thrive back in the real world.</p>

					<h2>TRIVIA</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>A Minecraft Movie was briefly shelved during its development.</li>
						<li>In the film, a snippet of "Minecraft" by C418 can be heard</li>
						<li>On Twitter/X, Jeb teased that the piglins in the movie survive in the Overworld by using nether wart in the same way as the piglins from Minecraft Legends.</li>
						<li>In a workprint of the film, "DJ Got Us Fallin' in Love" by Usher plays during the credits, notably being the same song remixed into the Minecraft pastiche "Revenge" by CaptainSparklez and TryHardNinja. The song is replaced by the original song "Zero to Hero" in the final cut.</li>
						<li>During the Midport Village introduction scene, a pig is seen wearing a crown, which Steve states is a "legend". This is a tribute to late YouTuber Technoblade, who passed away from his battle with sarcoma cancer mid-2022. In a later interview, it was revealed that Sebastian Hansen, who plays Henry in the film, was the one to suggest the idea to referencing Technoblade.</li>
						<li>When Matty The Waitress asks Marlene if she and Nitwit are "finished", Marlene responds, "No, I think he's Swedish". This is a reference to the game's studio originating and being situated in Sweden.</li>
						<li>During the Enderman nightmare scene, Steve is shown with white eyes similarly to Herobrine. According to producer Torfi Frans Olafsson on his Twitter/X account, the Herobrine reference was completely unintentional.</li>
